                    Many remember the long-known songs of Russian performers.
                    But not everyone knows, that some Russian rock is foreign hits.
                    At that time, even pop was not disdained. Of course, many have
                    indicated in their albums that this is a cover or alteration of
                    a certain Artist. For example, Yuri Klinsky (Khoy) from Gaza Strip
                    often remade songs to music. famous Western performers, periodically
                    indicating the author of the song or melody. Well, some did not hesitate
                    to "borrow" songs at that time. little-known Western performers because
                    of the "Iron Curtain" of the USSR. And you know these compositions?
                    We do not accuse anyone of plagiarism, we offer to take a quiz and
                    guess which song our artist is "similar" to a song by a foreign band.</span>
